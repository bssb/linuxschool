I've been using Linux in some capacity for 21 years, so I feel somewhat qualified to speak on the topic. I will be sharing my opinion on this website and I know some people will disagree with me at times. In addition to sharing opinion articles, I will also be posting tutorials and showcasing certain programs that are useful to me.
