I've been using Linux in some capacity for 21 years, so I feel somewhat qualified to speak on the topic. I will be sharing my opinion on this website and I know some people will disagree with me at times. In addition to sharing opinion articles, I will also be posting tutorials and showcasing certain programs that are useful to me.

One of the reasons I created this website is from my distain of video tutorials. These things are frequently outdated, inaccurate, incomplete...video content creators seem to focus on pumping out content in great quantites, rather than the quality and accuracy of their tutorials.
