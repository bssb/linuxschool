Now that neofetch is no longer being developed, what can I use? Well, the first thing to consider is that you can just keep using neofetch. The reason it's no longer being developed is because it's a mature project. Another project I use, [pacgraph](/posts/pacgraph), hasn't seen an update in 13 years and it's still really useful to me, with no known bugs.
## fastfetch
If you insist on using something that's under active development, the most obvious choice is going to be fastfetch. 

## screenFetch
Neofetch essentially was the successor to screenFetch, however the original still works just fine.
