I have tried a number of todo list applications and most of them fell short of my expectations.

My requirements:
- Tasks must be stored in a text file
- Must be able to synchronize using Google Drive

My todo.txt is stored in a Google Drive folder, managed by insync on my laptop. I usually don't use paid apps, but insync is the best software on Linux for Google Drive that I know of.

## Setup
I installed this using AUR:
```
paru -S todotxt
```
## Overall thoughts
things I wish it had:
- markdown style links in the task description
- space to attach longer notes to the task
