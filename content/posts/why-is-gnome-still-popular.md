Man, GNOME really sucks. On the surface it looks really nice and polished, but use it for any extended length of time and you will quickly grow frustrated with how oversimplified everything is. Here I will list my gripes with GNOME:

## It lacks basic features
No desktop icons.

## Can't theme anything other than a crappy "dark" or "light" mode.
No theming of GDM, stuck with an ugly gray background.

- Developers think they know best and so they don't allow certain things to be changed.
