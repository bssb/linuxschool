I was happy to learn that my favorite distro from the late 2000s has made a comeback.

## First impressions

I'll be honest, I find it painful to use a standalone floating window manager. The only way I'll use a floating WM is if it's part of a desktop environment like KDE or XFCE.

## Limitations

I at first allocated 8GB RAM to this VM, not realizing that I'm booting from a 32-bit kernel. No PAE support or anything like that, and it only detected 2GB.

## Overall thoughts

DSL is one of my favorite projects in FOSS, and its one of the distros that got me interested in Linux. I thought DSL was very cool 16-20 years ago, but now I'm not sure what it would be used for. Back then it could be used to revive an old computer. What's the point of that now? Even "old" computers by today's standards can run Ubuntu.
